# PythhonLab

PythonLab is a study project that serves to demonstrate some of the language's features and how to use them. This project can also be used as a short introductory lesson plan covering very basic features (variable declaration, if/else, try/except, etc.) up to advanced features such as reading and writing files, and reading Microsoft Excel files.
Because it is a console-type project, it has a menu with options for choosing and viewing some of the results of those choices, ideal for understanding the language.
